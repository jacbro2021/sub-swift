# Sub-Swift

## Purpose
Sub-Swift is an implementation of the a subset of the Swift programming language. This project is meant solely for educational purposes and may not perfectly (or even remotely) reflect the implementation of the Swift compiler. 

The project will follow a similar structure to the implementation of the swift compiler, by implementing the lexer, parser ,and sema, then converting the AST into the LLVM IR for optimizations and code generation. The implementation of SIL and the optimization of the output SIL will be left out for learning purposes, but may be added later.

For each of the respective parts of the compiler, I will be referring to the textbook "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" 2nd Edition by Aho, Alfred V. et al.

## Features 
** This section will be completed as features are added to the compiler. **
