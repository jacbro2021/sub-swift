# Sub-Swift

## Purpose
Sub-Swift is an implementation of the a subset of the Swift programming language. This project is meant solely for educational purposes and may not perfectly (or even remotely) reflect the implementation of the Swift compiler. 

The project will follow a similar structure to the implementation of the swift compiler, with the lexer and parser being implemented by hand, and then converting the AST into the LLVM IR for optimizations and code generation. The implementation of SIL and the optimization of the output SIL will be left out for learning purposes, but may be added later. 

## Features 
** This section will be completed as features are added to the compiler. **
